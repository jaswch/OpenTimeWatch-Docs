## Introduction

OpenTimeWatch is a project dedicated to building and sharing everything for a fully open smartwatch—both the hardware and the software.

The goal is to give you complete flexibility and control over the technology you wear.

The Project Includes:

1. OpenTimeWatch OS (Software): This is the operating system for the watch. It runs on the ESP32-S3 microcontroller and is currently supported on boards like the LILYGO TQT Pro. It allows users and developers to create their own apps, watch faces, and other features.

2. OpenTimeWatch 1 (Hardware): This is our own custom-designed smartwatch circuit board (PCB). The hardware files are also open-source, allowing you to see exactly how the watch is built. It's designed to be a simple, feature-rich base for future development.

We are bringing a change to smartwatches by making the entire platform—from the hardware to the look and feel of the software—fully transparent and customizable. You are welcome to explore, build, and contribute to both parts of the project!
